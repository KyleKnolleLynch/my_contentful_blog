### My personal blog built with..

- Next.js
- Contentful CMS
- Styled JSX
- Focus on accessibility

  Features:

  - Article search filter
  - Light/dark mode setting persistance using local storage
  - Use of semantic HTML/JSX tags along with additional aria attributes and labeling to support assistive technologies and screen readers
  - Fully responsive on mobile devices
  - Use of CSS custom properties, making the global color scheme easily customizable, contributing to reusability and modular structure
  - Contact form using nodemailer and react-hook-form
  - Toast notifications using context API and custom hook

(Big thanks and credit to [Adam Richardson](https://adamrichardson.dev/), his fantastic tutorials helped me implement the contact form and unique context API and custom hook setup for the toast notification functionality.)

My goal with building this blog application was to create a real-world, usable blog. Not only for my personal use, but a modular style 'template' app that I could make for a number of people to use and start their own blogs. So I designed it to be fairly customizable and easy for them to manipulate content.

With CSS grid and custom properties, I can quickly tailor the basic layout and color scheme to a bloggers request. I chose to use Contentful CMS for content management so everyone from an expert super-user to a not especially tech savy blogger could have a great and user friendly experience managing their blog site content.

Search Engine Optimization with Next.js is extremely good, with its nature of serving pre-rendered HTML pages. This, coupled with Next.js image optimization, makes this blog very powerful for me or a blogger to upload content or images quickly, resulting in great SEO and web optimization without having to spend time manually optimizing everything themselves.

While I don't have a lot of content on my blog currently, content-wise it's a work in progress, I am very proud of what I've achieved constructing this application. I feel I have attained my initial goal for this app, and would gladly share and help any person manage this application as their own real-world blog.

My next goal for this app would only be to improve and build upon it, as there is always room to improve things.

Thanks for reading and checking out this app!
